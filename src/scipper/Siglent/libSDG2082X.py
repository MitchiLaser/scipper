        Many SCPI commands are just querries for a boolean property. Sometimes it's the values "True" and "False", sometimes "ON" and "OFF", sometimes "1" and "0" ans sometimes setting the value requires another key of pairs than the device will return when querying the current setting. Therefore this wrapper function takes all possibilities for one specific SCPI command and converts from the boolean values `True` and `False` to the language the instrument is speaking.
        This function works in two directions (like the whole rest of this API): When no value which hast to be set was given to the function as an argument then the current setting will be read out from the device and returned. If the optional variable `value` was set then this function will return nothing but instead the setting inside the device is changed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scpi_cmd : str
            Ths SCPI Command to access the specified property in the device settings

        scpi_value_off : str
            The value which has to be send to the string in order to turn the setting off aka. setting the property to `False`
        err_description_class : str
            To provide error messages when something happens this helps specifying in which device control-object aka. class the error ocurred
        err_description_option : str
            Also useful to provide error information. This type of the error message specifies the SCPI command / function name / etc. for which the error ocurred. The rest of the error message is predefined.
        value : bool, optional
            When no parameter is specified then the current setting will be queried from the device and given back as a return value. When this value is set to something else than `None` then the setting in the device will change.
        scpi_return_true : str, optional
            Sometimes the device answers with another pair of keys than what is required to set a settings value. Therefore this can be used to specify which answer should be interpreted as a boolean `True`
        scpi_return_false : str, optional
